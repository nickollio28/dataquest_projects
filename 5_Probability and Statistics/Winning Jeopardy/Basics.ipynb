    "# Winning Jeopardy\n",
    "\n",
    "I will pretend I want to compete on Jeopardy, and am looking for any edge I can get to win. I will work with a dataset of Jeopardy questions to figure out some patterns in the questions that can help me win. The dataset, which you can download [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/1uyd0t/200000_jeopardy_questions_in_a_json_file) contains 20,000 rows where each row corresponds to a single question on a single episode of Jeopardy. Here are the explanations for each column:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Show Number -- the Jeopardy episode number of the show this question was in.\n",
    "- Air Date -- the date the episode aired.\n",
    "- Round -- the round of Jeopardy that the question was asked in. Jeopardy has several rounds as each episode progresses.\n",
    "- Category -- the category of the question.\n",
    "- Value -- the number of dollars answering the question correctly is worth.\n",
    "- Question -- the text of the question.\n",
    "- Answer -- the text of the answer.\n"
