# dataquest_projects
This repository contains the projects I have completed in my Data Science certification courses from DataQuest.
All projects are available in Jupyter notebook .jpynb files, as well as .html files


'1_Python Introduction' contains 2 basic data science projects

'2_Data Analysis and Visualization' contains 6 data science projects using the NumPy and Pandas libraries, as well as plots using the MatPlotLib.pyplot and Seaborn libraries for plotting

'4_Working with Data Sources' contains 3 projects. '1_CIA_factbook_data' and '2_Business_Analysis' were completed using SQL in the Jupyter notebook, and 'stack_exchange' was completed using web scraping in Python.

'5_Probability and Statistics' contains 5 data science projects involving probability and statistics

'6_Machine Learning Intro' contains 2 machine learning projects. 'predicting_car_prices' used K-Nearest Neighbors, and 'predicting_house_prices' used Linear Regression.



Note: The third course, 'The Command Line' was not included because there were no projects, because the projects were done in Jupyter Notebook which does not support BASH
