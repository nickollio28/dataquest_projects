# dataquest_projects
This repository contains the projects I have completed in my Data Scientist certification courses from DataQuest.
Most of the projects were done using Jupyter Notebook. The folders contain the .jpynb file along with any necessary datasets.

** Note: GitHub may not be able to render the Jupyter Notebooks. Simply copy and paste the URL of the Basics.jpynb file into https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/ and it will render the notebook there. You can also use [this link](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/nickollio28/dataquest_projects/tree/main/) to view all of my projects.

* '1_Python Introduction' contains 2 basic data science projects.

* '2_Data Analysis and Visualization' contains 6 data science projects using the NumPy and Pandas libraries, as well as plots using the MatPlotLib.pyplot and Seaborn libraries for plotting

* '4_Working with Data Sources' contains 3 projects, two of which were done in SQL and one of which was done using web scraping.

* '5_Probability and Statistics' contains 5 data science projects showcasing my abilities in probability and statistics.

* '6_Machine Learning Intro' contains 4 machine learning projects. 'Predicting Car Prices' uses K-Nearest Neighbors, 'Predicting House Prices' and 'Predicting the Stock Market' use Linear Regression. 'Predicting Bike Rentals' uses Decision Trees and Random Forests.

* '7_Machine Learning Intermediate' contains 2 machine learning projects. 'Building a Handwritted Digits Classifier' utilizes deep learning to classify handwritten digits. 'Creating a Kaggle Workflow' creates a pipeline of functions for submitting predictions for the Kaggle Titanic competition.

I will soon add projects for '8_Advanced Topics in Data Science' once I have completed the course.
