# # Profitable App Profiles for the App Store and Google Play Markets
# 
# For this project, we'll pretend we're working as data analysts for a company that builds Android and iOS mobile apps. We make our apps available on Google Play and the App Store.
# 
# We only build apps that are free to download and install, and our main source of revenue consists of in-app ads. This means our revenue for any given app is mostly influenced by the number of users who use our app â€” the more users that see and engage with the ads, the better. Our goal for this project is to analyze data to help our developers understand what type of apps are likely to attract more users.

# Finished cleaning data
# 
# Now time to analyze:
# - find app profile that is successful on both iOS and Android
#     - strategy for app idea:
#         - build minimal android version of app and add it to Google Play Store
#         - if app has good response, develop it further
#         - if app profitable after 6 months, build iOS version and add it to App Store
# - start by finding what most common genres are for each market
#     - build frequency tables for a few columns of data sets

# Analyze:
# - Apple:
#     - most common genre: Games
#     - second most common genre: Entertainment
#     - most popular genres are for entertainment purposes (games, entertainment, photo and video, social networking, sports, music)
#     - apps for practical purposes (education, shopping, utilities, productivity, lifestyle) not as common
#     - even though a genre is very common doesn't mean it has large number of users
#         - games most popular, and would be hard to break into
#         - most users still use less common genres such as social networking, photo & video, and music - would be easier to get a user base
#        
# - Google Play:
#     - most common category: Family
#     - second most common category: Game
#     
#     - most common genre: Tools
#     - second most common genre: Entertainment
#     - most common categories and genres are for practical purposes (education, shopping, utilities, productivity, lifestyle)
#     - on Android, you can customize your phone with apps much more than with iPhone
#         - many practical apps on Android may not be able to cross over to iOS
#             - can still be profitable on Android
#         - games not as common - can release game on Android where it has higher chance of gaining popularity
#             - transfer over to iOS once its already popular, and it can compete with their large population of gaming apps

# In Apple App Store, navigation seems to be the most commonly used, with reference and social networking following closely behind.
# - Navigation takes up only 0.19% of apple store apps, but is the most reviewed. This suggests that many users use a small amount of navigation apps. This seems like a good candidate for an app because there will be a large potential customer base with a small amount of competition
# - Reference is similar, though it will have over twice the competition (makes up 0.56% of app store) and approx. 13% lower customer base than navigation
#     - However, users may be more likely to download a new reference app than a navigation app. Many users may be uninterested in switching up their navigation apps, but may be interested in obtaining a new reference app.
# - Social networking and music also have large customer bases, however they take up a larger portion of the app store so there will be much more competition as well
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Google's Installs column may be a more accurate metric than Apple's number of ratings, however this metric is not very precise because it contains open-ended values (100+, 1000+, 5000+, etc.). This should work well enough to get an accurate picture, though. We will assume that 100,000+ will be 100,000, 10,000+ will be 10,000, etc.

# In the Google Play Store, communication is by far the most commonly installed. This category makes up 3.24% of the Google Play Store, which is not very high but not very low either. It may be difficult to get people to switch to new modes of communication, and it may be difficult to make money off ads from communication apps because users would be annoyed with ads when theyre trying to message. 
# 
# Video players and social media have the second and third most installs and make up 1.79% and 2.66% of the Google Play Store, respectively. These may be better suited for our profit motive because ads are very common on these platforms, and they have a lot of potential users with a relatively small amount of competition. Video players and social media will also transfer over to iOS better than many of the common apps on the google play store such as productivity apps, as they don't require any special permissions that users are able to give on android but not iOS.
# 
# 
# # Summary
# Overall, I would recommend creating a video player or social media app. They will give us a large potential customer base, and have a relatively small amount of competition. These genres are also well suited for ads.
# 
# Games are also a genre to consider, however the Apple App Store has a large amount of competition and it may be tough to gain a large enough user base to become profitable.
